# Usage:
# python autosamplerT.py --script conf/examples/multitimbral_drums.yaml
#
# This creates drum samples with:
# - 3 velocity layers per drum sound (soft, medium, hard)
# - 3 different drum kits per sound (Standard, Room, Power)
# - Total: 16 drum sounds × 3 velocities × 3 kits = 144 samples
#
# Sample naming:
# - Kick_v32_rr0.wav   (36, soft, standard kit)
# - Kick_v80_rr1.wav   (36, medium, room kit)
# - Kick_v127_rr2.wav  (36, hard, power kit)
# - Snare_v32_rr0.wav  (38, soft, standard kit)
# ... etc
#
# GM Drum Note Map (for reference):
# 35 = Acoustic Bass Drum
# 36 = Bass Drum 1
# 37 = Side Stick
# 38 = Acoustic Snare
# 39 = Hand Clap
# 40 = Electric Snare
# 41 = Low Floor Tom
# 42 = Closed Hi-Hat
# 43 = High Floor Tom
# 44 = Pedal Hi-Hat
# 45 = Low Tom
# 46 = Open Hi-Hat
# 47 = Low-Mid Tom
# 48 = Hi-Mid Tom
# 49 = Crash Cymbal 1
# 50 = High Tom
# 51 = Ride Cymbal 1
#
# Perfect for:
# - Drum machines with multiple kits
# - Hardware drum modules
# - Multi-timbral percussion samplers
#
# Post-processing recommendation:
# python autosamplerT.py --process "DrumMachine_3kits" --trim_silence --patch_normalize --dc_offset_removal
#
# Note: Make sure your drum machine/module supports:
# - Multi-timbral operation (multiple MIDI channels)
# - Program Change messages to switch kits
# - Velocity response (many drum machines do!)
