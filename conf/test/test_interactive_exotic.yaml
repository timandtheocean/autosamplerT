# Interactive Sampling Test: Exotic Instrument (Manual Pitch Control)
#
# Test Case: Instrument requiring manual pitch adjustment per note
# Use Case: Sample 13 notes (C4-C5) of theremin/pitch-CV instrument
# Expected: Pause after EVERY note for manual pitch adjustment
#
# Workflow:
#   1. Sample C4
#   2. Pause: Adjust instrument pitch to C#4
#   3. Sample C#4
#   4. Pause: Adjust instrument pitch to D4
#   5. Continue for all 13 notes (chromatic octave)
