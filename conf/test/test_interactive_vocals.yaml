# Interactive Sampling Test: Vocal Phrase Sampling
#
# Test Case: Vocal sampling with performer preparation time
# Use Case: Sample 25 notes (C3-C5) with timed breaks for vocalist
# Expected: Pause every 12 notes (octave), auto-resume after 30s
#
# Workflow:
#   1. Sample C3-B3 (12 notes × 2 velocities = 24 samples)
#   2. Pause for 30 seconds (vocalist rests)
#   3. Auto-resume or press Enter to continue
#   4. Sample C4-B4 (12 notes × 2 velocities = 24 samples)
#   5. Pause for 30 seconds
#   6. Sample C5 (1 note × 2 velocities = 2 samples)

  endNote: 72               # C5 (highest vocal note)
  noteInterval: 1           # Chromatic (all semitones)
  velocities: [60, 100]     # Soft and loud
  roundrobin_layers: 1      # No round-robin for vocals
  hold: 4.0                 # Long sustained notes
  release: 2.0              # Natural decay
  pause: 1.0                # Breath between notes

  every: 12                 # Pause after each octave (12 semitones)
  continue: 30              # Auto-resume after 30 seconds
  prompt: "Rest and prepare for next phrase. Auto-continues in 30s (or press Enter)..."

postprocessing:
  patch_normalize: true     # Maintain relative dynamics
  trim_silence: true        # Remove breath noises at start/end
  auto_loop: false          # Vocals don't loop
