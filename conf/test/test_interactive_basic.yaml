# Interactive Sampling Test: Basic Functionality
#
# Test Case: Minimal test to verify interactive_sampling works
# Use Case: Sample 10 notes with pause every 3 notes
# Expected: Pause after notes 3, 6, 9, complete at 10
#
# Workflow:
#   1. Sample notes 36-38 (3 notes)
#   2. Pause: Press Enter to continue
#   3. Sample notes 39-41 (3 notes)
#   4. Pause: Press Enter to continue
#   5. Sample notes 42-44 (3 notes)
#   6. Pause: Press Enter to continue
#   7. Sample note 45 (1 note)
#   8. Complete

sampling:
  startNote: 36             # C2
  endNote: 45               # A2 (10 notes total)
  noteInterval: 1           # Chromatic
  velocities: [100]         # Single velocity
  roundrobin_layers: 1      # No round-robin
  hold: 1.0                 # Quick test
  release: 0.5
  pause: 0.2
  test_mode: true           # Test mode (no recording)

interactive_sampling:
  every: 3                  # Pause after every 3 notes
  continue: 0               # Wait for keypress
  prompt: "Paused. Press Enter to continue..."

# Expected output:
# Sampling 10 notes total (36-45)
# Pause points: after notes 3, 6, 9
# Total pauses: 3
