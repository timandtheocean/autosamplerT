# Interactive Sampling Test: Casio SK1 Hardware Sampler
# 
# Test Case: Hardware sampler with limited MIDI range (32 notes)
# Use Case: Sample 65 notes (C1-C6) using 32-note hardware sampler
# Expected: Pause after notes 32, 64, and continue to 96
#
# Workflow:
#   1. Load first 32 samples into SK1
#   2. Run script - samples notes 32-63
#   3. Pause: Load next 32 samples into SK1
#   4. Press Enter - samples notes 64-95
#   5. Pause: Load final sample into SK1
#   6. Press Enter - samples note 96

sampling:
  startNote: 32             # C1 (lowest note to sample)
  endNote: 96               # C6 (highest note to sample)
  noteInterval: 1           # Chromatic sampling
  velocities: [100]         # Single velocity layer
  hold: 2.0                 # Hold time
  release: 1.0              # Release time
  pause: 0.3                # Pause between samples
  test_mode: true           # Enable test mode (no audio recording)

interactive_sampling:
  every: 32                 # Pause after every 32 notes (SK1 MIDI range)
  continue: 0               # Wait for keypress (manual bank loading)
  prompt: "Load next sample bank into SK1 memory and press Enter..."

postprocessing:
  normalize: true
  trim_silence: false       # SK1 handles timing
  auto_loop: false          # SK1 handles looping
