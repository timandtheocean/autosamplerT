# Interactive Sampling Test: Acoustic Drum Kit
#
# Test Case: Acoustic drums requiring per-note tuning
# Use Case: Sample 8 drums (kick, snares, toms) with velocity layers
# Expected: Pause after EVERY note for tuning
#
# Workflow:
#   1. Sample kick drum at 3 velocities
#   2. Pause: Tune snare to next pitch
#   3. Sample snare at 3 velocities
#   4. Pause: Tune tom 1 to next pitch
#   5. Continue for all 8 drums
